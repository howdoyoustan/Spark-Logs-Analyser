      "\n",
      "**Specific Technical Root Causes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Out-Of-Memory (OOM) Errors:** Executors are likely running out of memory due to data processing exceeding allocated resources. This causes the JVM to crash or the underlying container orchestrator (e.g., YARN, Kubernetes) to terminate the container.\n",
      "2.  **Aggressive Resource Manager Limits:** The cluster's resource manager may be configured with strict memory or CPU limits, leading to premature termination of executor containers if they exceed these thresholds, even before Spark reports an OOM.\n",
      "3.  **Network Instability/Timeouts:** Executors might be losing connection to the Spark Driver due to transient network issues or default network timeouts being too short. This leads the Driver to mark the executors as lost and terminate them.\n",
      "4.  **Insufficient Executor Resources:** The configured `spark.executor.memory` or `spark.executor.cores` might be too low for the workload, causing executors to struggle and crash under load.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation of Spark Terms:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided log summaries do not mention 'Data Skew', 'GC Pressure', or 'Shuffle'.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Concrete Configuration Changes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the severe executor instability and churn, consider the following configuration adjustments:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Increase Executor Resources:**\n",
      "    *   **`spark.executor.memory`**: Increase the memory allocated to each executor (e.g., from default 1g to `4g`, `8g`, or more, depending on your data and workload). This provides more memory headroom for data processing.\n",
      "    *   **`spark.executor.cores`**: Increase the number of CPU cores per executor (e.g., from `1` to `2` or `4`). This can help executors process tasks more efficiently if they are CPU-bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Adjust Network Timeout:**\n",
      "    *   **`spark.network.timeout`**: Increase this value (e.g., from the default `120s` to `300s` or `600s`). This can help prevent executors from being marked as lost prematurely due to transient network issues between the driver and executors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Review Cluster Manager Configuration:**\n",
      "    *   **Investigate YARN/Kubernetes/Mesos logs:** It is crucial to examine the logs from your cluster's resource manager for specific reasons why executor containers are being terminated (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError` in YARN container logs, `OOMKilled` events in Kubernetes pods). Adjust container memory requests and limits at the cluster level if they are too restrictive.\n",

      "    *   **Root Cause:** The logs report 54 executors with an average lifespan of just 0.53 seconds, which is a strong indicator of repeated executor failures, most commonly due to OutOfMemoryError (OOM) exceptions. This leads to wasted resources, re-computation, and overall application instability.\n",
      "    *   **Suggested Configuration Change:**\n",
      "        *   Increase `spark.executor.memory` to provide more heap space for executors (e.g., `spark.executor.memory 20g`).\n",
      "        *   Consider increasing `spark.executor.memoryOverhead` to account for off-heap memory usage by the JVM and external libraries (e.g., `spark.executor.memoryOverhead 4g`).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Persistent Deserialization Bottleneck:**\n",
      "    *   **Root Cause:** Multiple stages (0, 2, 4, 5) show a significant percentage of runtime spent on deserialization (up to 100.2% in Stage 4). Deserialization is the process of converting data from a byte stream (e.g., received over the network or read from disk) back into in-memory Java/Scala objects. High deserialization time indicates that the application is spending a disproportionate amount of CPU cycles on this conversion, potentially due to inefficient serialization formats, large object graphs, or frequent data transfers.\n",
      "    *   **Suggested Configuration Change:**\n",
      "        *   Enable and configure Kryo serialization, which is generally more efficient than Java serialization:\n",
      "            *   `spark.serializer org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer`\n",
      "            *   If using custom classes, register them with Kryo for optimal performance: `spark.kryo.registrator <your.KryoRegistratorClass>`\n",
